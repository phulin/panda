In order to build PANDA, we have a build.sh script in the QEMU directory with
some default options, but first, the prerequisites need to be taken care of.  We
recommend building LLVM and QEMU with the same compiler.  In order to build some
of the PANDA plugins inside of the QEMU directory, a compiler that supports
C++11 is required.

PANDA is known to build on debian 7 linux with the following steps.

1. Install some prereqs.

apt-get install build-essential 
apt-get build-dep qemu

2. Download and compile LLVM 3.3.  If building a debug build, use
the following command (note: the debug build is REALLY slow):

CC=gcc-4.7 CXX=g++-4.7 ./configure --disable-optimized --enable-assertions --enable-debug-symbols --enable-debug-runtime --enable-targets=x86 && REQUIRES_RTTI=1 make -j $(nproc)

If building a release build, use the following command:

CC=gcc-4.7 CXX=g++-4.7 ./configure --enable-optimized --disable-assertions --enable-targets=x86 && REQUIRES_RTTI=1 make -j $(nproc)

3. Compile & install distorm

follow instructions in distorm-read-only/INSTALL

3. Compile the QEMU part.  Note that if you want to use LLVM, you may need to
specify the location where your LLVM build is located.

cd panda/qemu
sh ./build.sh
