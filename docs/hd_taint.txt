Here is a map of all the information flows getting data to and from the hard drive.
Note, there are obviously flows between RAM and Regs.  But these aren't exclusive to HD.

A: Transfer from HD to ide device IO buffer.

   During record, in hw/ide/core.c, we insert an entry into the replay log about 
   the transfer.  

   This happens in both ide_sector_read, 
 
        rr_record_pirate_hd_transfer
          (RR_CALLSITE_IDE_SECTOR_READ,
           PIRATE_HD_TRANSFER_HD_TO_IOB,
           HD_BASE_ADDR + sector_num*512,
           (uint64_t) s->io_buffer,
           n*512);

   and in ide_dma_cb

        rr_record_pirate_hd_transfer
          (RR_CALLSITE_IDE_DMA_CB,
           PIRATE_HD_TRANSFER_HD_TO_IOB,
           HD_BASE_ADDR + sector_num*512,
           (uint64_t) s->io_buffer, 
           n*512);

   The function rr_record_pirate_hd_transfer lives in rr_log.c.  
   It writes to the replay log a skipped call to RR_CALL_PIRATE_HD_TRANSFER.

   During replay, the following code in cpu-exec.c 

   if (rr_in_replay()) {
     rr_skipped_callsite_location = RR_CALLSITE_MAIN_LOOP_WAIT;
     rr_set_program_point();
     rr_replay_skipped_calls();
   }

   will execute all skipped calls that were logged in the io thread during record. 
   When the skipped call to RR_CALL_PIRATE_HD_TRANSFER is "executed" in replay, it 
   executes the folowing code in rr_log.c's rr_replay_skipped_calls_internal():

   case RR_PIRATE_HD_TRANSFER:
   {
     // run all callbacks registered for hd transfer                                                                   
     RR_pirate_hd_transfer *hdt = &(args->variant.pirate_hd_transfer_args);
     panda_cb_list *plist;
     for (plist = panda_cbs[PANDA_CB_REPLAY_HD_TRANSFER]; plist != NULL; plist = plist->next) {
       plist->entry.replay_hd_transfer
         (cpu_single_env,
          hdt->type,
          hdt->src_addr,
          hdt->dest_addr,
          hdt->num_bytes);
     }
   }

   In taint.cpp, there is a callback registered for PANDA_CB_REPLAY_HD_TRANSFER,
   cb_replay_hd_transfer_taint(), which uses the arguments passed to it to
   construct a taint op for the bulk taint copy and add it to the taint op buffer
   tob_op_thread.

   Note that the taint ops in tob_io_thread get consumed in XXX.


B: Transfer from IO buffer to HD

   Similar to A, but in reverse.

   in hw/ide/core.c: 

   ide_sector_write() has

      rr_record_pirate_hd_transfer
        (RR_CALLSITE_IDE_SECTOR_WRITE,
         PIRATE_HD_TRANSFER_IOB_TO_HD,
         (uint64_t) s->io_buffer,
         HD_BASE_ADDR + sector_num*512, 
         n*512);

   ide_dma_cb() has

        rr_record_pirate_hd_transfer
          (RR_CALLSITE_IDE_DMA_CB,
           PIRATE_HD_TRANSFER_IOB_TO_HD,
           (uint64_t) s->io_buffer,
           HD_BASE_ADDR + sector_num*512, 
           n*512);


C: Transfer from IO buffer to RAM directly via DMA

   During record, in hw/ide/pci.c, bmdma_rw_buf calls pci_dma_write or pci_dma_read,
   which call pci_dma_rw, which finally calls cpu_physical_memory_rw.
   cpu_physical_memory_rw does the actual DMA, but also, when we are recording,
   it writes an entry to the replay log when it calls 

   rr_device_mem_rw_call_record which just calls rr_record_cpu_mem_rw_call
   to record a skipped call to cpu_physical_memory_rw

   In replay, that rr log entry results in a call to cpu_physical_memory_rw in rr_replay_skipped_calls_internal.

   This, in turn, activates the appropriate panda callbacks in cpu_physical_memory_rw_ex 
   in exec.c for the RAM case. Note, this code appears twice, once for is_write=1 (qemu buf -> guest ram)
   and again for is_write=0 (guest ram -> qemu buf)

   if (rr_mode == RR_REPLAY) {
     // run all callbacks registered for cpu_physical_memory_rw ram case             
     panda_cb_list *plist;
     for (plist = panda_cbs[PANDA_CB_REPLAY_BEFORE_CPU_PHYSICAL_MEM_RW_RAM]; plist != NULL; plist = plist->next) {
       plist->entry.replay_before_cpu_physical_mem_rw_ram
         (env, is_write, buf, dest, l);
     }
   }

   For taint transfer, in taint.cpp, the following function gets registered under PANDA_CB_REPLAY_BEFORE_CPU_PHYSICAL_MEM_RW_RAM

    cb_replay_cpu_physical_mem_rw_ram(CPUState *env,
     uint32_t is_write, uint64_t src_addr, uint64_t dest_addr, uint32_t num_bytes) 

   And this is what adds a bulk copy taint op to the TaintOpBuffer tob_io_thread corresponding to
   the dma.  If is_write=1 it adds a copy corresponding to IO -> RAM.  Else, it adds a copy in the other direction.  

   Note that the taint ops in tob_io_thread get consumed in XXX.


D: Transfer from RAM directly to IO buffer via DMA

   This is actually the is_write == 0 case mentioned in C.  

   

E: Transfer from IO buffer to port for output

   During record, in ide/core.c, in ide_data_readw, we call 

      rr_record_pirate_hd_transfer
        (RR_CALLSITE_IDE_DATA_READW,
         PIRATE_HD_TRANSFER_IOB_TO_PORT,
         (uint64_t) s->data_ptr, 2);
   
   Again, this is recorded as a skipped call.  From here on, things
   work about the same as in A & B.  Replay runs the PANDA_CB_REPLAY_HD_TRANSFER callbacks,
   and the cb_replay_hd_transfer_taint one does taint transfer IOB -> Port via another
   block copy. 

   
F: Transfer from port to IO buffer

  Same as E, except in reverse.

   During record, in ide.c, in ide_data_writew, we call 

      rr_record_pirate_hd_transfer
        (RR_CALLSITE_IDE_DATA_WRITEW,
         PIRATE_HD_TRANSFER_PORT_TO_IOB,
         (uint64_t) s->data_ptr, 2);

   ide_data_writel is simlar.

      rr_record_pirate_hd_transfer
        (RR_CALLSITE_IDE_DATA_WRITEL,
         PIRATE_HD_TRANSFER_PORT_TO_IOB,
         (uint64_t) s->data_ptr, 4);


G: Transfer from port to a register

   In ops_template.h, in the fn op_inw_T0_T1, if something is tainted 
   (some labeling event occurred in the past), then we just go ahead and
   write a taint op to the taint op buffer for processing:

   iferret_log_info_flow_op_write_81(IFLO_HD_TRANSFER_6_DEST, T1_BASE, 2);

   This is part of a taint transfer initiated by E above.  Here we have the 
   destination, which is the register T1, in this case.  

   Note that there are no checks if we are in record or replay.  That is
   because this code executes both during record and replay, as it isnt
   device code.  We rely on the fact that taint is only tracked during replay
   to ensure that it will only do something during replay and only after
   some taint labels have been applied.  

   port	-> T1, i.e., T1 = in(port=T0)

   op_inw_T0_T1                 IFLO_HD_TRANSFER_6_DEST
   op_inl_T0_T1                 IFLO_HD_TRANSFER_7_DEST

   port -> T0, i.e., T0	= in(port=DX)

   op_inw_DX_T0                 IFLO_HD_TRANSFER_8_DEST	
   op_inl_DX_T0                 IFLO_HD_TRANSFER_9_DEST


H: Transfer from register to port
 
   in ops_template.h

   T1 -> port, i.e., out(port=T0, T1)

   op_outb_T0_T1                IFLO_HD_TRANSFER_SRC_5B_T1_BASE
   op_outw_T0_T1                IFLO_HD_TRANSFER_SRC_5W_T1_BASE
   op_outl_T0_T1                IFLO_HD_TRANSFER_SRC_5L_T1_BASE

   T0 -> port, i.e., out(port=DX, T0)

   op_outb_DX_T0                IFLO_HD_TRANSFER_SRC_10B_T0_BASE
   op_outw_DX_T0                IFLO_HD_TRANSFER_SRC_10W_T0_BASE
   op_outl_DX_T0                IFLO_HD_TRANSFER_SRC_10L_T0_BASE
